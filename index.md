### Rethink

Adam Grant: What frogs in hot water can teach us about thinking again \

> \[...\]"**escalation of commitment to a losing course of action.**" It happens when you make an initial investment of time or money, and then you find out it might have been a bad choice, but instead of rethinking it, you double down and invest more. You want to prove to yourself and everyone else that you made a good decision. Escalation of commitment explains so many familiar examples of businesses plummeting. Blockbuster, BlackBerry, Kodak. Leaders just kept simmering in their slow-boiling pots, failing to rethink their strategies. Escalation of commitment explains why you might have stuck around too long in a miserable job, why you've probably waited for a table way too long at a restaurant and why you might have hung on to a bad relationship long after your friends encouraged you to leave. 

> Research suggests that instead of foreclosing on one identity, we're better off **trying on a range of possible selves**. Retiring from diving freed me up to spend the summer doing psychology research and working as a diving coach. It also gave me time to concentrate on my dorkiest hobby, performing as a magician.

> Believing that the best way to prove yourself is to improve yourself, knowing that **weak leaders silence their critics and make themselves weaker, while strong leaders engage their critics and make themselves stronger.** Confident humility gives you the courage to say "I don't know," instead of pretending to have all the answers. To say "I was wrong," instead of insisting you were right. It encourages you to listen to ideas that make you think hard, not just the ones that make you feel good, and to surround yourself with people who challenge your thought process, not just the ones who agree with your conclusions. And sometimes, it even leads you to challenge your own conclusions, like with the story about the frog that can't survive the slow-boiling pot.
